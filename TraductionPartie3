The data of travelling time between two geographical points on the globe are extremely voluminous and can be obtained e.g. through a googlepmaps API,
by sending a request in form of a URL, in which information such as city of departure, city of arrival, means of transportation (train or automobile)
and travelling date should be specified.  
  
For the reason that as users of the free version of this service we are only allowed to initiate requests with a very limited numbers of cities of departure and 
arrival (10 at a time), it is necessary to automize the procedure of data acquisition. In order to do this we've written a program in Python which,
based on a series of French cities numbered after their population size, chooses at each time a different range of departure and arrivial cities, indicates
as well the transport means and date that we need, returns finally the URL of right format including this information which can be accepted by the GOogle API. 
Once we get the reponses of our requests in the form of a .json file, we then feed it to another Python program which in its turn associates
a number of departure city, a number of arrival city, a transpotation means and a date to each of the responses.
