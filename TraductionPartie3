The data of travelling time between two geographical points on the globe are extremely rich and can be obtained e.g. through a googlepmaps API,
by sending a request in form of a URL, in which information such as city of departure, city of arrival, means of transportation (railway or automobile)
and travelling date should be specified.  
  
For the reason that as users of the free version of this service we are only allowed to initiate requests with a very limited numbers of cities of departure and 
arrival (10 at a time), it is necessary to automize the procedure of data acquisition. In order to do this we've written a program in Python which,
based on a series of French cities numbered after their population size, chooses at each time a different range of departure and arrivial cities, indicates
as well the transport means and date that we need, returns finally the URL of right format including this information which can be accepted by the Google API. 
Once we get the reponses to our requests in the form of a .json file, we then feed it to another Python program which in its turn decodes the travelling time
of each of the responses
given a number of departure city, a number of arrival city, a transpotation means and a date.  

The number of journeys to be treated in our problem increases at a square speed as that of the cities we will consider. Thus, it's simply impossible to
take into account all places that one can name all over the country. However, we still would like to enable a single query of such kind initiated
by the user. For exemple, we could let the user to enter in a field an arbitrary place of his choice in order to obtain its accessibility.

### 3.2 Visualization structure

The visualization of cities accessibility starts in the first place with a synthetic view: a topographic map of France, where "mountains" represent cities
that are easier to access and valleys the ones who have a lower accessibility.  
  
The main part of the visualization takes the form of a national map as well. However, here, the user is asked to position his cursor over a city.
This action will trigger off a coloration of the maps, whether in gradually changing gray or in contour blocks, as being shown in the figure, where
the shade of the color represents the travelling time from other places of France to this city (or the other way round from this city to other places).
The advantages to use a colored map in our visualization are here very clear: one can not only rapidly grasp the accessiblity of other places in France
with respect to this city, but the comparison of the distances in terms of travelling time to the geographical ones is also immediate.
It is noteworthy as well that we offer the user two options in the visualization: he could switch between railway and automobile as transportation means and between
summer and winter as the season that the journey should take place, for the reason that depending on the month of a year, the SNCF timtable and tha road condition of the highways could also vary.
Forthermore, we also give the user the possiblity to select both of the tranportation means. In that case, the map will be display with two colors,
each of them representing respectively train or car, indicating the quicker way to get to a place. Again, such representation with a colored map is attractive, in the way that
it could bring immediately the competitivity of both transportations means to light.
